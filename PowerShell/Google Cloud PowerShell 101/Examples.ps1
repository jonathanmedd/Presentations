# --- Examine the current project
# --- Watch out for the project name, might not match the Projectid
# --- My project was named "My First Project", but the Projectid is "second-folio-233216"

Get-GcpProject

# --- Where's the New-GCPVM cmdlet?
# --- There isn't one.......
# --- OK. Google Compute Engine VMs are referred to as instances. Where's the New-GceInstance cmdlet?
# --- There isn't one.......
# --- OK, what do I do?
# --- Well of course, you should use Addâ€‘GceInstance! #facepalm
# --- But first of all (according to the documentation - https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-powershell/#/google-compute-engine)
# --- you have to define the machine configuration......

gcloud compute networks create testjmcustom --subnet-mode=custom

# --- Then again use gcloud to add subnets to it
# --- Note the subnet spans a region, not a zone!

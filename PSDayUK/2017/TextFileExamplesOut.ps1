# --- Out-File vs Set-Content - what's the difference?
# --- 1) Locking. Out-File: another app can read the file, Set-Content another app cannot
# --- 2) Encoding (defaults). Out-File: UTF16, Set-Content: ANSI (Often Windows-1252)
# --- 3) Formatting

# --- 4) Also some difference around empty file creation and additional parameters
